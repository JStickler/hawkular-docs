= Adding a Middleware Provider in Red Hat CloudForms

Now that CloudForms and the Middleware manager has been correctly installed, it
is time to add the Middlware manager as a CloudForms Middleware Provider.

To do so, go to http://my_cfme_host/ and login with a user who is allowed to
add providers. The default user is `admin` with `smartvm` for his password.
