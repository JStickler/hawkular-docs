Installing the  {ProductName} solution involves installing the following components: 

* *Middleware management server*: A JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 7 based application that collects metrics and events from middleware servers and sends that data to the {product-title_short} console. The middleware management server also executes operations on middleware servers.  This is delivered as a Linux container image.
* *Cassandra datastore*: Storage for middleware inventory and time series data. Only the middleware manager communicates with the metric store and it is not supported for any other use. This is delivered as a Linux container image.
* *Middleware management agent*: You install an agent on each JBoss middleware instance to be managed.  Once installed and enabled, the agent can push metrics and events to the middleware management server.  The agent is delivered as a Zip file in the middleware manager container.
