= Installation Overview

////
QUESTION - Are there any specific permissions the installing user needs?
Any special entitlement notes we need to mention?
////
Before you begin installing {ProductName}, you should have the following information:

* A non-root user to perform the {ProductShortName} server installation.
* A user with permission to write to the Cassandra data store (used for ongoing operations).  This can be the same non-root user who performs the installation.

The installation workflow is as follows:

. Install and configure Docker
. Install and configure the Cassandra datastore
. Install the {ProductName} server
. Add the middleware provider to {product-title_short}
. Install the {ProductName} agent on EAP servers
. (Optional) Add nodes to Cassandra
