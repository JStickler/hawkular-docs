= Instrument an Enterprise Application Platform 7 server

== Download the agent installer

To instrument an EAP server and be able to monitor and manage it from CloudForms,
we first need to embed an agent within the server.

The EAP agent installer is available within the Middleware manager. We need to access
`http://my_mwmanager_host:8080/`, click on the link "EAP Agent Installer" then
enter the credentials for the Middleware Manager:

It will download a file name `hawkular-wildfly-agent-installer.jar` that we need
to copy on the same host as the EAP server that we want to instrument.

== Install the agent in Enterprise Application Platform

Once downloaded we run the following command to install the embedded agent, in
standalone and/or domain mode depending on how EAP is expected to run.

=== Standalone mode

[source, bash]
----
java -jar ~Downloads/hawkular-wildfly-agent-installer.jar
   --target-location=/opt/jboss-eap-7.0/
   --server-url=http://192.168.1.123:8080
   --username=my_mwmanager_username
   --password=my_mwmanager_password
----

=== Domain mode
[source, bash]
----
java -jar ~Downloads/hawkular-wildfly-agent-installer.jar
   --target-location=/opt/jboss-eap-7.0/
   --target-config=/opt/jboss-eap-7.0/domain/configuration/host.xml
   --server-url=http://192.168.1.123:8080
   --username=my_mwmanager_username
   --password=my_mwmanager_password
----

== Verify in CloudForms
Once installed, start or restart EAP, then access the Middleware Provider that was
already configured in CloudForms.

WARNING: The new WildFly server will not appear immediately
