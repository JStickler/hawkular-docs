= Middleware Management Overview


Middleware management in {product-title_short} is a provider based on the http://www.hawkular.org/[Hawkular] open source project.  The middleware provider extends {product-title_short} management capabilities to JBoss Middleware application containers running in managed virtual machines, hosts, and Linux containers. The provider will deliver inventory, events, metrics, and power operations.  

When feature complete, the middleware provider will replace the current Red Hat middleware management offering, https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-jboss-operations-network[JBoss Operations Network].
