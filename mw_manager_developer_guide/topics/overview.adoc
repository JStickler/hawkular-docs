ManageIQ= Overview

This documentation is designed for contributors to Hawkular Services and the Middleware Provider of ManageIQ/CloudForms.

In general a product will need to register itself to Hawkular Services and expose metrics and operations through Hawkular's REST API (or a supported client). ManageIQ will need to be modified to read from Hawkular Services and expose those server/metrics and operations.
