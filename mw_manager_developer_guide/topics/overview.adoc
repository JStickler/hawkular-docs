= Overview

This documentation is designed for contributors to Hawkular Services and the Middleware Provider of ManageIQ/CloudForms.

In general a product will need to:
 - register itself to Hawkular Services
 - expose/push metrics to Hawkular Services
 - expose operations to be executed from Hawkular Services 
 
All done  through Hawkular's REST API (or a supported client).
Once the metrics are collected and operations exposed, ManageIQ will need to be modified to read from Hawkular Services and expose those server/metrics and operations.

Projects layered on top of WildFly benefit from an existing agent that can read metrics exposed through DMR or Jolokia and execute DMR operations.
