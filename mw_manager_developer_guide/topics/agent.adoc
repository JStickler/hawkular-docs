= Agent

In general, Hawkular is a push model. A resource or agent push metrics to Hawkular Services at regular or irregular intervals. 
Agents may be embedded in the resource or not. For WildFly, the choice was made to have a agent in the form of a subsystem.

== WildFly based projects

TODO: Instructions on how to use the WildFly agent to register the resource, expose metrics and operations. Wildfly layering requirements (such as declaring the product name correctly...)

== Non WildFly based projects

TODO: Instructions for non-Wildfly based agent. What API to use, what tags/structure to use...
